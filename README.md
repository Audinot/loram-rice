# LORAM Rice
---
*Custom Arch+Sway, designed for the RPi Zero 2W with under 512mb RAM*

The challenge I set for myself was to build a useable desktop on a 
Raspberry Pi Zero 2w, as well as a satisfying rice. The keyword is 
that it must be *useable.* Unsatisfying performance was unacceptable. 
With only 512mb of RAM, only 418 of which show up as useable on htop, 
and no way to upgrade it, this means the installation and rice must be
lean. Here is a guide to getting your own $15 riced and ready for work!
